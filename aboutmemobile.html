<p>I am an illustator and painter based in Queens, New York. As a youth,
   I always dreamed of becoming an artist. I was inspired by my older cousin, who
   had a special talent in drawing Dragon Ball Z characters. Throughout my childhood,
   he gave me great advice and taught me techniques to becoming a better artist. Once
   I entered High School, I was put in AP art courses, which challenged me
   and pushed me to become the artist I am today. After graduating
   High School, I then went on to get my AS degree
   in Fine Arts from LaGuardia Community College. There, I learned amazing drawing and
   painting techniques that really took my skills to the next level. Now,
    I am in Queens College majoring in Graphic Design with the hopes of recieving a
     bachelors degree and implementing some digital work into my art using adobe
  softwares such as photoshop, illustrator, premier, InDesign, etc.</p>
