                <p>My name is Michael and i am an app and graphic deisgner i'm 23 years old and design actually was not somwthing i ever did i was just creative and full of ideas but didn’t see a way to sharing them in some art forn. Growing up i was all about sports football , soccer , and basketball played all; was pretty good at those , but thats where i was introduced to design. I found it weird, most designers are usually artist at first or painters etc sports was the last place i would think to find a love for deisgn. More importantly it was a way to help people and that is important to me; just being of service to others with my creativity thats what i bring to everyone i work with, a helpful service that brings your ideas to life. parent’s behaviors, and parents react back in an equally negative manner. This sets up a self-reinforcing pattern of interaction. Unless we work to change our own behavior, we cannot help another change theirs. We need to respond rather than react </p>
